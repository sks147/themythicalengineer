Are you tired of dragging windows around and resizing them everytime you open or close an app in your workspace?

For the past several years I have tried numerous window management softwares like [Moom](https://manytricks.com/moom/), [Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com/) and [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/).

I was using [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/) since last year and was quite happy with the ability to move windows around quickly with keyboard shortcuts. I used to work on a multiple monitor setup, so it was easy to manage multiple windows and partitions on big screens.

I was working on Linux for a while and bumped on [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/), which is a **tiling window manager**. The nicest thing about a tiling manager is you can control nearly everything from the keyboard.

> It's very quick and easy to set up side-by-side windows, and resizing one automatically resizes the other. It really helps on smaller screens, since by default everything takes full space on screen with minimal window decoration.

As I switched back to my 13" Macbook again, I felt the lack of efficient window management on macOS. I started searching for a solution and found this open source project [Yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/).

I use most of my IDE and terminal in full screen now due to the shortage of screen size. Whenever I open an app, it splits the previously active and new window in half and after closing it, the active window restores to full screen in a snap. That saves me few extra clicks of resizing the windows again and again.

This has improved my workflow and increased my productivity a lot.

You can follow the steps below to quickly get it running on your system.

## Step 1: Disable System Integrity Protection

* Turn off your device
* Hold down `commandâŒ˜``R` while booting your device.
* In the menu bar, choose Utilities, then Terminal

```bash
# If you're on macOS 10.14 and above, run
csrutil enable --without debug --without fs

# If you're on macOS 10.13, run
csrutil disable
```
* Reboot your system
* Verify that System Integrity Protection is turned off by running `csrutil status`, which returns System Integrity Protection status: unknown / disabled
<br/>

* You can use this while SIP is enabled, but you'll lose some cool features.


## Step 2: Install Homebrew
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is a package manager for macOS. Similar to `pacman` on arch or `aptitude` on ubuntu

Open Terminal and run

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```

## Step 3: Install Yabai
```
brew install koekeishiya/formulae/yabai
```
Start `yabai` service
```
brew services start yabai
```

You will get a prompt to allow `yabai` accessibility permissions. You can navigate to Security & Privacy, then Privacy, then Accessibility.

Now install the scripting addition.
```
sudo yabai --install-sa
```

Restart Dock.app to load the scripting addition
```
killall Dock
```

## Step 3: Configure Yabai
Create a configuration file and make it executable
```bash
touch ~/.yabairc
chmod +x ~/.yabairc
```

There are multiple options for [configuration](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/wiki/Configuration#configuration-file) you can put in `yabairc` file.
Important configuration for tiling is binary space partitioning layout (bsp)
```bash
yabai -m config layout                       bsp
```
I also like to keep the auto balance on. In this configuration, windows always occupy the same space, independent of how deeply nested they are in the window tree.
```
yabai -m config auto_balance                 on
```

Make sure to restart the service to see the changes

```
brew services restart yabai
```
Here is a small demo of the working setup.
